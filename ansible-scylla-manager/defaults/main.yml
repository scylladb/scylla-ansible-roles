# If there are Scylla clusters to connect to, specify them below:
# The cluster parameters are as follows:
# - cluster_name: my_cluster_name
#   host: IP of a Scylla node from the clustr, a single IP is enough
#   auth_token_file: A plain text file containing the auth token. If ansible-scylla-node role was used it
#                    will be generated in the same dir as the playbook
#   without_repair: true|false - when cluster is added, Manager schedules repair to repeat every 7 days.
#                   To create a cluster without a scheduled repair, use this flag
#   username: user
#   password: password
#             optionally you can provide CQL credentials to the cluster. For security reasons the user
#             should NOT have access to your data. This enables CQL query based  health check compared to
#             credentials agnostic health check if you do not specify the credentials. This also enables
#             CQL schema backup, which is not performed if credentials are not provided.
