# 1. To use your own CA, place it in ${localhost_cert_path}/ssl/ca/{{ scylla_cluster_name }}-ca.crt and its respective key in
# ${localhost_cert_path}/ssl/ca/{{ scylla_cluster_name }}-ca.pem and derived per-node certificates will be generated from it, if they are not present.
# 2. To use your own node certificates, create a directory per hostname (same as in the inventory) in ${localhost_cert_path}/ssl/{{ hostname }}
# and place the .pem and .crt files as {{ hostname }}.pem and {{ hostname }}.crt respectively and then place the CA you used to sign the certificates in
# ${localhost_cert_path}/ssl/ca/{{ scylla_cluster_name }}-ca.crt and its respective key in ${localhost_cert_path}/ssl/ca/{{ scylla_cluster_name }}-ca.pem.

# Two types of encryption keys are available: System Keys and Table Keys.

# System keys can be used for encrypting system data, like commit logs, batches and hints logs.
# However, in the context of table keys (for encrypting sstables), if the user decides to use
# a Replicated Key Provider, a system key will also be necessary for encrypting the encrypted_keys table,
# where the replicated keys will be kept.
# If you want to use this role for managing your system keys, regardless of them being used for system_info encryption
# or for encrypting the encrypted_keys table, you should set {{ handle_system_keys }} to true and place all of your system
# keys under the {{ localhost_system_key_directory }} folder. The role will copy all the local keys to the {{ system_key_directory }}
# of every node.
# Note that by default the {{ inventory_hostname }} is part of the localhost_system_key_directory. This allows you to define
# different keys per host.
# e.g.:
# If your localhost_system_key_directory is set to "{{ inventory_dir }}/encryption_at_rest/{{ inventory_hostname }}/system_encryption_keys"
# and you have the following file tree:
#
# ├── encryption_at_rest
# │   ├── node1

# │   │       └── key1
# │   ├── node2

# │   │       └── key2
# │   └── node3
# │       └── system_encryption_keys
# │           └── key3
# └── inventory.ini
#
# At the end of the process node1 will have key1, node2 will have key2 and node3 will have key3.
# On the other hand, if you want to have the same keys for all the hosts you can define a {{ localhost_system_key_directory }}
# without the {{ inventory_hostname }} in it or simply copy the same key for all the node folders.

# Table keys are used for encrypting SSTables. Depending on your key provider, this key is stored in different locations:
# Replicated key provider - encrypted_keys table
# KMIP key provider - KMIP server
# KMS key provider - AWS
# Local key provider - in a local file with multiple keys. You can provide your own key or Scylla can make one for you.

# You can use this role for managing your local table keys. In order to do so, you need to set {{ handle_table_keys }} to true
# and place all of your local table keys under the {{ localhost_table_key_directory }} folder. The role will copy all the
# local table keys to the {{ table_key_directory }} folder.
# Note that by default the {{ inventory_hostname }} is part of the localhost_table_key_directory. This allows you to define
# different keys per host.

# Encrypt system resources:
# System encryption is applied to semi-transient on-disk data, such as commit logs, batch logs, and hinted handoff data.
# Note that for system info encryption, only the following key providers are supported:
# LocalKeyProvider: Stores the key on the same machine as the data. Please use the system_info_encrypt_local config.
# KMIPKeyProvider: External key management server. Please use the system_info_encryption_kmip config.
# KMSKeyProvider: Uses key(s) provided by the AWS KMS service. Please use the system_info_encryption_kms config.

# If you decide to use a LocalKeyProvider and also want the role to manage the local key that will be used, make sure you
# have {{ handle_system_keys }}, {{ localhost_system_key_directory }} and {{ system_key_directory }} set appropriately.
